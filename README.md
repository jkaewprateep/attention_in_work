# Attention in work - documents task example
🧸💬 ```Attention in work```, we had discussed the attention networks and the application of network preferences. Now we compare attention in works and ```attention network preferences``` and how ```IT documents``` examples. ```User story```, ```IT help support file```, ```screen mapping UI/UX functions```, ```Survey document```, and ```IT networks incident diagrams```. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 A project design document, action plan documents such as ```IT networks migration risks```, ```impacts analysis```, ```software specifications environments```, ```application communication, and protocols``` are required to be submitted during the project ```implementation phase(s)```, or after the implementation phase as they are input of the next phase method and preparation for the ```next IT team engagement```. In the ```data information transparency``` policy, they subdivided the IT team into multiple teams and they had responses in different phases, in ```work communications and documents``` are trace logs and verified. One tool is training and IT project document because of working initially from code and read through backlog tracing is time-consuming but it is required by the ```project manager``` of the solution and sub-team communication is to verify that the method is ```repeatable and consistent``` . </br>
🦤💬 ```Document formats```, number and timeline is an agreement of the IT's project because sometimes customers have maintenance contracts with the same IT implementing company and that occurs during the IT project's initial negotiation. In some IT's projects, we build active links response or interactive help support documents as in the figure below and it does not take much time to verify hyperlinks in the document and conversion. </br>

## 🧸💬 IT help support file - active help files or document pages types

🐐💬 There are some IT requirements that he could read documents from a ```document helper reader``` with ```active links``` for working with ```time challenges with support users in the IT organization```, verification links both online and offline, and ```can share``` updated documents inside the department, placed on the ```Intranet links``` and safe and ```exported as document pages``` type ```.pdf``` . </br>
🐑💬 ➰ ```If it cannot be read please use previous versions of the document helper reader``` . </br>

🦭💬 In an application submitted there are ```settings file``` may contained of therse file types ```application settings``` and ```users settings```, and they need to contain of ```readme file``` or ```descriptive readme file```. In example software library submit they need to include help that could be read with the method uses interaction with sample ```object browser```, ```readme file in installation wizard```, and ```explanation in the installment scripts```. 🐑💬 ➰ ```In the object explorer, you may place the correct matching intellisenses object and description to help users organize their program```. </br>

👧💬 🎈 I found ```Opscode return``` description values but how do you organize the Opscode values when there are multiple customer's requirements and system environment ⁉️ </br>
🐑💬 ➰ The off-line document or object explorer document does not ```actively update``` and they had a version, replied from the server of valid Opscodes you are managing and the description is most correct and you have ```version string number``` server tries to manage for ```backward compatibilities``` then your organization had the maintained code internally. </br>

[ Sample project - website ](https://github.com/jkaewprateep/RaycastMaze/blob/main/README.md) 👧💬 🎈 The help files can help file format, pages format, web site, and document. For example, you can place the GitHub or website into a help file and it supports using an Intranet website. </'br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 ```Sometimes we call the Opscodes messages to return the humanity exceptions, that is because the current process will have an alternative way to have information or process your information with the system requirements provided a description``` . </br>
🐯💬 In the ```security process challenges``` the manager challenges the IT programming team that there is no OpsCode description return and the list of valid actions that need to be validated and maintained into separate documents for the project. That will require service requests when implementing a project and communication within the organization when the list may not be updated and drawbacks from the updated codes need to be updated by all teams and documents. The ```versions controls``` of documents and ```API``` are implemented and organized by a trackback logging system. </br>
🐯💬 ```The object description from the API reflecting from the object browser is correct and the server return object message description is the most correct. ``` </br>

[ Sample project - Counter clocks ](https://github.com/jkaewprateep/counter_clocks/blob/main/README.md) 🥺💬 The Opscode is built in the numericway because of actual code is in extensions format as common communications in Microsoft program and the OpsCods is selection preference matrix. </br>
🐐💬 Continue study there is Opscode matrix preference and Opscode in transform communication, someone can reveal to you how we select active actions for clients and screens. </br>

## 🧸💬 IT sample screen mapping file - Business attributes / Tabular / Timeline

🧸💬 ```Visualization``` and ```data matric mapping```, visualization can present with mapping functions matrixes into ```Power Point file``` when data matrix from server's message data extraction collection can store into a ```database file``` or ```Excel worksheet file```. </br>
```🐑💬 ➰ Each item can communication in both database query result sets and file communication format including .json file and .txt file return as format of web services or medium``` </br>

## 🧸💬 IT surveys document

🐨🎁🎵🎶 ```An important process that the IT implementor team is not familiar with is a public survey when designing documents and customer contact to our contact center after a policy or campaign is launched, there is one method is to create a survey document using online channels and public channels. The output of the process is value information required transformation to data information process in the next steps``` . </br>
